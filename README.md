# radiation_monitor
The Radiation Monitor collects radiation levels from all available stations around the world and shows 5 nearest stations to your location and one station with highest current readings and one station with the highest 24 hour average readings. The QuickApp uses the location (latitude and ongitude) of your Homecenter to measure the distance to the stations and to get the nearest stations. The bearings in degrees from your location to the stations is shown. 

The main device shows the nearest sample μSv/h 
There are Child Devices for:
- Nearest sensor 24h average μSv/h
- 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th nearest sensor sample μSv/h with the 24 average in the log text
- Nearest maximum sample μSv/h
- Nearest maximum 24h average μSv/h


Radioactive@Home is a Polish science project using the distributed computing capabilities of the BOINC platform. The main goal of the project is to create a free and continuously updated map of radiation levels available for everyone, by gathering information about gamma radiation using sensors connected to the computers of volunteers willing to participate in the project. Project is completely non-commercial, participating will be free of charge (excluding cost of detector) and the software will be licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

In land navigation, a 'bearing' is ordinarily calculated in a clockwise direction starting from a reference direction of 0° and increasing to 359.9 degrees. Measured in this way, a bearing is referred to as an azimuth by the US Army but not by armies in other English speaking nations, which use the term bearing.

μSv/h: The sievert (symbol: Sv) is a unit in the International System of Units (SI) intended to represent the stochastic health risk of ionizing radiation.

The human population is continuously exposed to ionizing radiation from several natural sources (cosmic and terrestrial contributions). For most individuals, exposure to natural sources exceeds that from all man-made (artificial) sources combined. The man-made sources arise from peaceful (e.g. medical use, energy generation, and associated fuel cycle facilities, radioisotope production, waste management) and military purposes (nuclear tests and their fallout or radioactive release, nuclear explosions).

Radiation levels: 
Green: Radiation up to 0.3 μSv/h
Yellow: Radiation between 0.3 and 0.8 μSv/h 
Red: Radiation above 0.8 μSv/h

1.14 µSv/h - Shelter population
5.7 µSv/h - Evacuation of population
11.4 µSv/h - Issue Iodine tablets
0.114 µSv/h - Max daily dose == 1 mSv/year

Reverse Geocoding by Nominatim
Reverse geocoding generates an address from a latitude and longitude. The reverse geocoding API does not exactly compute the address for the coordinate it receives. It works by finding the closest suitable OSM object and returning its address information. This may occasionally lead to unexpected results. 

QuickApp code logics:
- onInit() Initialise the QuickApp
- getQuickAppVariables() Get all Quickapp Variables or create them
- createVariables() Setup the global variables
- setupChildDevices() -- Setup all child devices
- loadMap() Get the webpage from http://radioactiveathome.org/map/ (This is the main loop of the QuickApp)
- extractData() Extract the data from the webpage source-code
- geoDistance() Calculate the distance from the HC3 (QuickApp variables) lat/lon to the sensors lat/lon
- geoBearing() Calculate the bearing from the HC3 (QuickApp variables) lat/lon to the sensors lat/lon
- Check for the values to give the right dot colours for the sample and average measurements
- Store the values of all sensors in a table and sort the table on distance
- Run through the table to get the maximum sample and maximum average measurements. If there are more than one, get the one that is the nearest-by
- updateIcon() Set the icon (colour) based on the sensor measurement
- getCity() Get the cities and countries for the seven selected sensors from https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ and store them in a table
- updateLabels() Update the labels
- updateProperties() Update the properties
- updateChildDevices() Update the Child Devices
- Return to the main loop loadMap()

- icon_refresh = User defined icon number for refresh status
- icon_green =   User defined icon number for values less than 0.3 μSv/h
- icon_yellow =  User defined icon number for values between 0.3 and 0.8 μSv/h 
- icon_red =     User defined icon number for values greater than 0.8 μSv/h
- icon_error =   User defined icon number in case of an error gettng the data
